# hello-world

Seems like makig this repository is a matter of politeness,
so do I do it ...

(and I never made a pull request so let's train a bit)

## me, myself and I

Hello, my name is Guillaume,
(but we are 3 in my head, at least)

I live in south-east **France**, near **Lyon**,
writing code mostly for fun but one day
I hope to start my little website affair
just for friends and colleagues who want 
a little presence on the web

## ideas

I got a ton of ideas
that in my vision seem revolutionary
but in reality are far too complicated
for my skills, at least.

## you

SO if you like one of my ideas
and believe it could work,
or if you got an idea that I could help with,
do not hesitate to contact me,
because I'd be very glad
to work with other people.
